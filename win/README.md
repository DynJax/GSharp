# GSharp for Windows
Visual Studio project files for building G# macro-programming library <br/>
GUI application to convert G# code into plain G-code using the library

Version 1.0

Description
-----------
*the general library description is under the [GSharp](https://github.com/nrsoft/gsharp) main page*

The source files in this directory are for building the library and GUI application for Windows OS. It's been tested under Windows 10, but there is nothing specific in the code which would prevent it from being built under different Windows versions.

The library and the application project files were created using the free community edition of [Visual Studio 2015 Express](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-express-vs.aspx)

To build both the library and the application open "GSharp.sln" solution file in Visual Studio and build under the desired configuration (Win32 or x64).

The generated executables are under "Release\_Win32" or "Release\_x64" directories.
